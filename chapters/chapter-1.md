# Chapter 1: Introduction

This is the very beginning of the official guide to learning Onyx. You're probably here because you heard about Onyx, and you sort of know what it is, but the picture is still fuzzy. That's okay! Learning to use a distributed system is an inherently difficult task. There are, by definition, a lot of moving parts. The abstractions are usually foreign, you're dealing with multiple machines, and there's likely a big chunk of data that you're trying to work with! I can sympathize. I'm going to take you through a thorough journey of how to use Onyx effectively. By the end, I hope you're as excited as I am to start building applications with Onyx!

## About this guide

There's a lot of things that I'm going to touch on in this guide. It's split up into 11 chapters. The first 4 chapters cover distributed data processing in the general sense. Before we can dig into how to use Onyx, I want to establish the principles that I believe good data processing software is built ontop of. Grab a coffee, pour a glass of wine - whatever suits you. Sit back and have a gentle read about the approach we're taking. With that behind you, you'll have a more intuitive understanding about how things work when we get into Onyx's API.
